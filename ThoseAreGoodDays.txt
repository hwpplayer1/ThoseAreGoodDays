Those are good days

Night after night
I found myself touching you 
On the edge
Without a strange
Smiling face

Then here we are starting to fight 
for what is right
To understand
To feel and rise

Nights going over and over again
On the streets with rain
Just turning another page
In my mind

And those are the doors
For our good days 
And those are the good days
Just living in a dream while awake
